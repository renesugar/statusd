# StatusD

StatusD is a small server that checks configured endpoints if they are available
or not. If any of these endpoints (other servers) don't respond within a defined
time frame or return a non-200 status code, they are marked as offline.

On any status change a certain Slack channel can be notified.

Additionally, there is a small JSON HTTP endpoint where other services can
request information about the current status of one of the endpoints.
